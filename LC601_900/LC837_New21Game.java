     * Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".
     *
     * Alice starts with 0 points and draws numbers while she has less than k points. During each draw, she gains an
     * integer number of points randomly from the range [1, maxPts], where maxPts is an integer. Each draw is
     * independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.
     *
     * Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets k or more points.
     *
     * Return the probability that Alice has n or fewer points.
     *
     * Answers within 10^-5 of the actual answer are considered accepted.
     *
     * Input: n = 10, k = 1, maxPts = 10
     * Output: 1.00000
     *
     * Input: n = 6, k = 1, maxPts = 10
     * Output: 0.60000
     *
     * Input: n = 21, k = 17, maxPts = 10
     * Output: 0.73278
     *
     * Constraints:
     *
     * 0 <= k <= n <= 10^4
     * 1 <= maxPts <= 10^4
     * @param n
