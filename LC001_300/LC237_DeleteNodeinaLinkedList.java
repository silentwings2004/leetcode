     * Write a function to delete a node in a singly-linked list. You will not be given access to the head of the list,
     * instead you will be given access to the node to be deleted directly.
     *
     * It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the list.
     *
     * Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
     * Output: [4,1,9]
     *
     * Constraints:
     *
     * The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range [2, 1000].
     * -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
     * The value of each node in the list is unique.
     * The node to be deleted is in the list and is not a tail node
     * @param node
